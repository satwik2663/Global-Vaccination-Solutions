# Global-Vaccination-Solution: A Java Swing Application for healthcare domain 

## Problem Statament
From 93 children of every 1,000 dying before age five and about 29,000 children under the age of five – 21 each minute – die every day, mainly from preventable causes. <br>
According to the WHO Reports, in 2015, nearly one in five infants –19.4 million children – missed out on the basic vaccines they need to stay healthy<br>
Big countries like Brazil and China reduced their child mortality rates 10‐fold over the last 4 decades. Other countries – especially in Africa – still have high child mortality rates

## Aim
Help the vaccination shortage across various under-developed countries with providing them with a network with WHO and various developed countries to get vaccinations to decrease the child mortality rates

## Project Summary 
To create a prototype of a global vaccination solution with an aim to provide vaccinations and health service to the country with high child mortality rates.

## APPROACH - Object Model

## Key Functionalities
1. Creating a system to provide and maintain data of vaccinations available in a country with an interconnected network. 
2. As per the trend of increasing mortality rates, creating a platform for physicians to provide medical training to chosen physicians in a country. 
3. Organizing events in orphanges for providing them with care and vaccination services.

## Special Features
1. Graphs and reporting systems with the analysed data for vaccination services. 
2. Email system integrated to generate email to the country, admin to initiate a request depending upon the vaccination availability as per the recent mortality rates 
3. Track of physician visits across countries to educate and boost the medical facilities.
